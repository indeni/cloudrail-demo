# Cloudrail: context-aware cloud security tool

## Test examples

To try any of these test cases, go to the specific test case's directory, create a TF plan and run an evaluation with Cloudrail. For example:

```
# cd test/aws/terraform/disallow_ec2_classic_mode_rule/deploy_redshift_in_ec2_classic_mode
# terraform init
# terraform plan -out=plan.out
# cloudrail run --tf-plan plan.out --directory . --auto-approve -v
```

NOTES:
1. You do not need to run ```terraform apply``` as Cloudrail can simply analyze the plan. If you would like, you can apply the entire test case in your AWS account and see you are getting the same results. If you'd like to be even more creative, you can apply some of the resources first, then run a plan that will add only the remaining resources. Cloudrail is capable of understanding all of these scenarios.
2. When the Cloudrail CLI container analyzes your plan, it needs access to some files in the directory where the plan was created. These files are NOT uploaded to our service, and are only used locally for analysis.
3. If the ```--auto-approve``` flag is excluded, the Cloudrail CLI will show you what it's going to upload before it does so. ```--auto-approve``` simply skips that step.
4. If you'd like, you can split the ```run``` into two phases: ```cloudrail generate-context``` which will generate the filtered Terraform context and save it to a file, and then ```cloudrail run``` which will take the filtered context file as input. This allows you to run various data scanning tools before uploading the content to the Cloudrail Service.
