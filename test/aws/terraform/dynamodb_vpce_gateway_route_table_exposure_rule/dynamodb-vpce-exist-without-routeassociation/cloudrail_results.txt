Rule: Ensure all security groups and rules have a description detailing the rule
Description: Cloudrail will review your security groups. If a security group is using a default description, or has a rule which does not include a description, this rule will trigger.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html to update the security group or security group rules description field.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_security_group and aws_security_group_rule resources, set description argument with a proper value.
